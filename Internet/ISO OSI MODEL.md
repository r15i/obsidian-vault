Levels:
 1. Physical layer
 2. [[Data Link layer(DLL)]]
 3. [[Network layer]] 
 4. [[Transport layer]]
 5. [[Session layer]]
 6. [[Presentation Layer]]
 7. [[Application Layer]]
 

# Layer to layer communication

# Encapsulation

# Protocol Data Unit (PDU)
- a Protocol Data Unit (PDU)  at level N
- we refer as Protocol Data Unit (PDU) as the payload of a certain layer
# Service Data Unit (SDU)
- a Service Data Unit (SDU) at level N-1
- we refer as Service Data Unit as the payload of an upper layer
# Protocol Control Information (PCI)(header)
each layer adds a Protocol Control Information (PCI)(header) to make the new PDU
at each transmission we have a process of Encapsulation and Decapsulation
