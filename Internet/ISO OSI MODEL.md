Levels:
 1. [[Physical layer]]
 2. [[Data Link layer(DLL)]]
 3. [[Network layer]] 
 4. [[Transport layer]]
 5. [[Session layer]]
 


- Communication goes by layer to layer
![[Pasted image 20231201181351.png]]

each layer send downward unit of data : 
- a [[Protocol Data Unit (PDU)]]  at level N
- a [[Service Data Unit (SDU)]] at level N-1

each layer adds a [[Protocol Control Information (PCI)(header)]] to make the new PDU
at each transmission we have a process of [[Encapsulation and Decapsulation]]
