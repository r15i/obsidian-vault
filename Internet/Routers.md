## uses :
- Regenerates the signal it receives (PHY)
- checks the Physical Address (source and destination) in the packet ([[Data Link layer(DLL)|DLL]])
- checks the network-layer addresses ([[Network layer|network]])
- caching of data to increase network [[Traffic metrics#Throughput $S$ [Bit/s ], [pck/s ], [pck/slots ] |Throughput]]
