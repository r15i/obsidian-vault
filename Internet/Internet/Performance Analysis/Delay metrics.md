## End-to-End Latency {Delay}: $d_{e2e}$ \[s\]
The time taken to deliver a  complete  message to the intended receiver 
from the time the first bit is sent out from the surce:
### $d_{e2e} = d_{proc} + d_{queue} + d_{trans} + d_{prop}$

#### Processing Delay  $d_{proc}$ : 
Time required to process a packet in a router or destination host
(REDUCED WITH ROUTING ALGORITHMS)


#### Queuing Delay  $d_{queue}$ :    
Time a packet waits in the router queue


#### Transimission Delay $d_{trans}$ :


#### Propagation Delay $d_{proc}$ :
