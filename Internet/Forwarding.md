- Forwarding can be defined as the **Action** applied by each routed when a datagram arrives at one of its interfaces
- The decision-making table a router normally uses for applying this action is sometimes called **routing table** or **forwarding table**
- To make the decision when a packet arrives the router uses the **destination address** in the datagram header, to find the corresponding output interface number in the routing table
