IDEA: offers global exchange $\rightarrow$ network packets can be routed(they pass from one local area network to another)

## Services 
[[Net Framing]]: encapsulation in a datagram into network data gram packets
[[Routing]]: determine route taken by packets from src to destination (**routing algorithms**)
[[Forwarding]] : move packets from router's input to appropriate router's output

#### Other services
All these other are left to the upper layers:
- Error control
- Flow control
- Congestion control
- Quality of Service

Only this one is  Security  implemented in a virtual sub layer called **IPSec**.

- [[Internet Protocol (IP)]]
- [[Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)]]
- [[Internet Group Management Protocol(IGMP)]]
