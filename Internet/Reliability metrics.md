PHY LAYER can deliver packets with errors:
- low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) at the receiver (due to path loss), or 
- strong **interference**, or **packet collision** 

**Packet Error Rate/Ratio/Probability (PER)**  
$PER= \frac{\#ERROR\,PACKETS}{\#PACKET}$

**Packet Reception Rate/Ratio/Probability (PDR)** 
$PDR =\frac{\#DELIVERED\,PACKETS}{\#PACKET}$

**Packet Loss Rate/Ratio/Probability (PLR)** 
$PLR=\frac{\#NOT DELIVERED\,PACKETS}{\#PACKET}$
