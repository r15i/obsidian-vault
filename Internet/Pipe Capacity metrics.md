 ## Bandwidth-Delay Product (BDP) \[bits\] \[pcks\]

how many unit of data we can send before saturating the link

The maximum long-term average number of bits that can be transferred in a 
e2e delay interval
**AKA the number of bits that can "fill" the Link**

$BDP\,[bits] = R_0,[bits/s] \times delay [s]$
