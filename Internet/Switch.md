Is a [[Data Link layer(DLL)]] device more flexible than a [[Bridge]]
## uses:
- has **filtering** capabilities by checking the destination address of a frame and can **decide** from which outgoing port the frame should be sent, using a **local routing table** or a **filtering database (FDB)** .
- Divides in different broadcast domains

# Switching 
The switch has a key role in the [[Network Architectures]] since it can work in different **modes**:

- static switching (with static switching tables to be edited manually)
- dynamic switching (which  has dynamic tables that *gradually learns* and add new entry)
## Operational switching modes

- [[Circuit-switched network (CS)|circuit switched ]]
- [[Packet-switched network (PS) |packet switching ]]
- [[Message switched network |message switching]]
