# Interframe Space (IFS)

- when an idle channel is found, the station does not send immediately. it waits for a period of time called **interframe space** or **IFS**
- The IFS time allows a signal TXed by **distant** station to reach the station 
- After waiting an **IFS**, if the channel is still idle, the station could send, but it still needs to wait a time equal to the **contention window**
- The IFS can also be used to **prioritize** station or frame types (for example , a station that is assigned a shorter IFS has a higher priority)
