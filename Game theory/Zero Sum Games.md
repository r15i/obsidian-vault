Special class of games, easier to solve

IDEA: Zero-sum games represent a strategic interaction between 2 players, where their payoff sum is 0 for every possible outcome.We speak of **zero-sum game** if $u_i(s)=-u_{-i}(s)$

Zero-sum games are actually a bigger class

They have a easier computation beeing subject to multiple theorems:
## Zero Sum in minimax

[[Minmax And Maximin]] theorem, puts them in close relationship to [[Linear Programming|Linear Programming duality]] and implies that polynomial-time procedures for finding [[Nash Equilibrium]] exist.
As an example in network , trying to **maximize** a some network parameter, we have a **maximizer**
meanwhile an attacker tries to **minimize** it hence calling it **minimize**.
