1. when it's his turn p2 sees p1 move $a_1^h$ and solves the optimization problem

2. Call $R_2(a_1^h)$ the argmax solving the problem, $a_2$ yelding the max .
	due to complete info, 1 anticipates 2's reaction and solves:![[Pasted image 20231218143538.png]]
3. 1's solution $a_1*$ , the outcome is $a_1^*\,,R_2(a_1^*)$ is **is the NASH equilibrium in pure strategies**
