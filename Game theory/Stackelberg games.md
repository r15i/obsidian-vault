It is a sequential version of a [[Static Game of Complete Information|static game]]
- players move alternately (**Leader** and **Follower**) 
- represented with a bi-matrix
- the backward induction outcome is called the Stackelberg equilibrium

### Stackelberg idea 

- The leader has "first-move advantage"
- leader payoff $\geq$ than in Nash equilibrium
- follower payoff $\geq$ minimax

For adversarial/competitive setups, more specifically for zero-sum games, however the **leader being better off means that the follower is worse off**

**This is very Strange** since the follower actually has **more information**
