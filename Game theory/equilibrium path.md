The equilibrium path is the path described by the  [[backward induction]] process 

tho note that the combination of strategies that show this path is not based only on the result of the backward induction process but also to 
based on the rationality in other areas **not in path and OFF EQUILIBRIUM** wich means that the resulting SPE  combination of stratiegies it needs to be rational even in the choices not actually tanken by the path
