A strategy is a plan of action 


## Pure Strategy
A pure strategy is a fully deterministic strategy, can be seen as a degeneration of a mixed strategy 
## Mixed Strategy

A set of possible probability distributions over $A$ is called the **simplex** and denoted as $\Delta A$

For a Normal form of a probability distribution $(S_1,...,S_n;u_1,...,u_n)$, a mixed strategy for player i is a probability distribution $m_i$ over set $S_i$ 
So $i$ chooses strategies in $S_i = (s_{i,1},...,s_{i,n})$ with probabilities $(m_i(s_{i,1}),...,m_i(s_{i,n}) )$  

so we watch tie utility as

exist many types of strategies as :
