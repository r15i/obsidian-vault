
 The information set $h_i$ is the available information that a player $i$ has at a certain stage of a dynamic game

if the information set is a singleton ${x_j}$ ($|h_i| = 1$)  then the node is fully aware of the previous moves 

Every player $i$ has a collection of information sets $H_i$ such that $h_i(x_j) \in H_i$
is associated to a node $x_j$ where it is $i$'s turn to move
Characteristics 
- we assume $x_j \in h_i(x_j)$ 
- if $h_i(x_j)$ is a singleton $\{x_j\}$, then player $i$ can move knowing for sure he/she is a node $x_j$

# Indifferent information sets

in this case we say that the information set of player B is $\{x_1,x_2\}$ is not a singleton
