A belief of player $i$ is a possible profile of oppnents' strategies: an element of set $\Delta S_{-i}$ (**which is the same definition of pure strategy but with $\Delta$**)

As before, a best-response-correspondence is 
BR: $\Delta S_{-i} \rightarrow p(\Delta S_{i})$ associates to $m_{-i} \in \Delta S_{-i}$ a subset of $\Delta S_{-i}$ such that each $m_i \in BR(m_{-i})$ is a best reponse to $m_{-i}$
