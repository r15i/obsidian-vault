Players can be of different types, which implies them to behave differently and also the other players to have beliefs about it

Actually, types can represent more than just different preferences:
- Types may not differ in the playre's preferences but in the *knowledge* that a player has about the types of the other player of some other characteristics of the game
- More subtle variant: we keep it for a later stage
