### Idea :
Involves players moving first, and others moving later, (by some kind of turn)
Characteristics:
- [[Complete Information]]
- we can distinguish with [[Perfect Information]] and [[Imperfect Information]]

Other related :
- [[Minmax And Maximin]]
- [[Stackelberg games]]
## Representation by extensive form

the unfolding of the "time" dimension is made by using the [[Extensive form]]

For example in this graph the payoff of B is different cause he knows the choice of B


## Re-definition of strategies
In a dynamic game we have the additonal role by the **hystory of play**
(through information sets)
A player's [[Strategy#Pure Strategy|pure strategy]] specifies an action according to what happened in the game.

#### Mixed Strategies

#### Behavioral strategies

note that behavioral = mixed if the property of [[Perfect recall]] holds 
### From Extensive to normal form 

#### Extensive $\rightarrow$ Normal form

#### Normal $\rightarrow$ Normal form 
In this case we have multiple equivalences

## NE in dynamic games
[[Dynamic Nash Equilibrium]] in dynamic games has different behaviour
and also we have an extension of the nash equilibrium concept with [[Subgame-perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPE)]]


## Different types of dynamic games
- A dynamic game with [[Perfect Information]] is a [[Sequential games]]
- [[Sequential games]]
- [[Zero Sum Games]]
- [[Competitive or adversarial games]]

## Time inconsistencies 
[[Contradictory discounting ]] is very important because allow us , as a side derivation to justify :
- everytime we combine different discounted payoffs, we always do **exponential** discount
- other choices lead to incosistencies that are not coherent with rationality
