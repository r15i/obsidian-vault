Equilibrium concepts were developed earlier as modeling players that are forming **consistent and correct beliefs**

IDEA:
Game of [[incomplete information]], beliefs over the characteristics of other players are captured by their [[types]]


we will develop an equilibrium concept that still requires these beliefs to be consistent and correct (so we use the same procedures)

## Preliminary Nature's move 
Players may have different payoffs (each represented by a [[types|type]])

The timing of the game is as follow:
- Nature draws a type vector($t_1,....,t_n$) among all possibiliteies for all the players
- Nature reveals type t_i , to player i only 
- Players choose their actions
- Payoffs are computed
- IN this kind of dynamic game where the playes do NOT know Nature's move in its entirety


## Example

Now we can assume P2 :
- **Rational**: behaves as already discussed 
- **Crazy**: enjoys fighting and his/her payoff for (Enter,Fight) is actually 2 instead of -1
Is actually Nature that sets the type of 2: with probability p to be "Rational"

## Dynamic Game with types

### Representing Bayesian games
Normal-form games (TILL NOW):
- set of players $N$
- strategy space of each player $S_i$ (for i = 1..n)
- utilities of players $u_i:(S:1,S_2,...S_n)\rightarrow R$ (for i = 1..n)
Bayesian games add 3 additional characteristics:
1. [[types]] and type **space** of each player $T_i$ (for i = 1..n)
2. also, utilities are now **type-dependent**
3. finally, we need **beliefs** about other players types
