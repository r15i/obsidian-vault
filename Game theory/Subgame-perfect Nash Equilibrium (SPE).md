A Nash equilibrium is  Sub-game-perfect  if the strategies chosen by the players give a NE in **EVERY** sub game


NOTE: **Every finite extensive form game has an SPE**
This means that every game, from tic-tac-toe to chass has a way to be optimally played

## Uniqueness of SPE
For perfect information game with finite horizon, SPE is the outcome of [[backward induction]]

this can be somehow extended for other dynamic games, by taking into account the [[credibility of threats]] of the threats
