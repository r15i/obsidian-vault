A [[Strategy#Mixed Strategy| Mixed Strategy]] at Nash equilibrium should give the same payoff to the other player for all the [[Strategy|strategies]]

$Example:$ 
P1 plays $pA + (1-p)B$  and P2 can choose between $\{D,E\}$ 
$u_{p2}(p,D) = u_{p2}(p,E)$
$u_{p2}(pA + (1-p)B,D) = u_{p2}(pA + (1-p)B,E)$
$p\,u_{p2}(A,D)+ (1-p)\,u_{p2}(B,D) = p\,u_{p2}(A ,E)+ (1-p)\,u_{p2}(B,E)$
