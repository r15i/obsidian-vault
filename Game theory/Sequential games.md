A sequential game is a [[Dynamic Game of Complete Information]]  with [[Perfect Information]]

In a sequential game of n stages, players alternate in making their moves.

In the case of [[Perfect Information]] the players moves being informed  of all the previous moves
It is actually only relevant to the players to move, since the players are also generally assumed to have [[perfect recall]],so they do not forget past moves

Players move one after another , and later players have full information on previous player choices

## Solving Sequential Games

This class of games can be solved by [[backward induction]]

We can assume that player 2 can always optimize his/her move:
- Because of [[Perfect Information]], player 2 knows the right information set(singleton)
- Thanks to [[Complete Information]] player 1 can anticipate the optimization and do the same
- Also we assume that that these  caracteristics are  [[Common Knowledge]]  for all the players

## Information set in sequential games
Because of the properties mentioned above of the clearly specified order of moves and full information about the past history of the game

**In a sequential game with perfect information the [[Information Set]] of each node is a [[singleton]]**


## Rappersentation 
The [[Extensive form]] may be preferred beacuse it preserves the dynamic character of the game
the [[Normal form]] can also be used but need to rapresent all the possible strategies for each player 
wich means all the possible combination of strategy that the player can use

for example in this tree $P_1$ has only 2 possible strategy $(a_1,a_2)$  meanwhile the possible combination for player 2 are 2 for each possible choice of $P_2$ witch means $(b_{a_1},b_{a_2})$  , which rappresent all the possible choices of a_1 and all the possible coices of a_2
