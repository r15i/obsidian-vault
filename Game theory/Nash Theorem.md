 **IDEA** : Every game with finite $S_i$ has at least one [[Nash Equilibrium]] (possibly involving mixed strategies)
![[Pasted image 20231130215436.png]]
interpretation of mixed strategies :
- Large numbers: if the game is played M times, mixed strategy $q$ = choose a pure strategy $qM$ times (note: each of the M times is one-shot memoryless)
- Fuzzy values: Unsure actions: players do not know
- [[Beliefs]]: the probability q reflects the uncertainty that my opponent has about my choice (which is pure)



the Nash theorem is obtained by using the [[Kakutani’s Fixed Point Theorem]] 
to a global best-response **BR**
[[Brouwer’s Fixed Point Theorem]]
