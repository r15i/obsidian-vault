Way to describe what outcomes are preferable 

They are  reflexive and antisymmetric binary realtions described as  $\succcurlyeq$  and can be :

- Complete :  if $\forall a,b \in A,\ a\leq b \lor b\leq a$

- Transitive :  if $\forall a,b,c \in A ,\ a\leq b \land b\leq c$  ---> $a\leq b$  

- [[Rational]] :   if $Complete \land Transitive$


A preference ≽ can be put in relationship with a [[Utility function]] u : A → ℝ

$Theorem$: On a finite set $A$ , $\succcurlyeq$ can be represented by u if it is [[Rational]]
