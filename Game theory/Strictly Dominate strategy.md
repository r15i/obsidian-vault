If $s_i,s_i' \in S_i$ 
**we say that $s_i$ is strictly dominated by $s_i'$  
if i's payoff when playing $s_i'$ *is greater than when playing $s_i$*
for any other strategies of the other player 

### $u_i(s_1,...s_i',...s_n) \textless u_i(s_1,...s_i,...s_n)$
### $\forall \,(s_1,...s_{i-1},s_{i+1},...s_n) \in S_1 \times ... \times S_{i-1} \times S_{i+1} \times ...S_n$


such kind of strategies are used in [[Iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies (IESDS) |IESDS]]
