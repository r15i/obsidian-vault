## Project definition 
A project is a sequence of unique, complex, and connected [[Activities]], that have one goal or **purpose** and that must be completed by a specific time within budget, and **according to specification**


Project are not viewed in isolation:  
**an enterprise will have a [[collection]]  of all types of projects running in parallel**

>while the accountants will tell you that everything can be reduced to dollars,(and they are right) you will separate resources as defined here. they are independently controllable by the project manager and need to be separately identified for that reason 


# Classification of projects 
Common rule for classifying projects : risk (high, med,low,very low) ,business value ,Time length, complexity ,tech used ,number of departments, Cost, Size , Type , Application , Complexity and Uncertainty 


## Project Types 
usually divided in 5 types A,B,C,D
based on duration , risk complexity , tecnology , likehood of problems from a shorter high risk , high complexity , tecnology breaktrhou  and certain problem , to D longer, very low risk , tecnology practical, few problems
# Constraint of a project 
Limits of a project: 
- Scope: Boundary of the project functional specification 
- Cost
- Time
- Resources
- Risk 
- Quality :
    -  Product quality : the quality of the deliverable product of the project 
    - Process quality : the quality of the project management itself 
## Scope triangle 
### Graph to show the relation between the constraint of a project 
![[Pasted image 20231129194020.png]]
NOTE: Risk is NOT integral part of the scope triangle but it is always present and spans all parts of the project (external, internal)

is used in **problem escalation strategy** reference for *impact statement 
part of the scope change process(PIS)**

Using the triangle allow to perform problem resolution asking "who owns that" to perform:
- Scope change impact analysis: aiding in the preparation of the project impact statement

### prioritizing the scope triangle variables for improved change management 
allows to rate the variables of scope. quality, time ,cost and resource availability 
from 1-5 as for more critical to more flexible 

basically where is better to gave into when needed



## Applying the scope triangle 
### Business-focused definition of a project

**A project is a sequence of finite dependent activities whose successful completion 
result in the delivery of the expected business values that validate doing the project**

it isn't focused on the **propose of a project** which is to deliver business value to the client and to the organization
