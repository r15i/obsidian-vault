# Brain storming TPM (Technical Performance Measurement)
When using brainstorming to scope a TPM (Technical Performance Measurement) project, you may incur the risk of:

**a) Evaluating the ideas**

The risk highlighted in option (a) is that prematurely evaluating or critiquing ideas during the brainstorming process can hinder the free flow of creative thinking. Brainstorming sessions are intended to generate a wide range of ideas without immediate judgment. If the team starts evaluating ideas too early in the process, it may stifle creativity and limit the exploration of innovative solutions.

In a successful brainstorming session, the focus should initially be on generating a large number of ideas without criticism. Evaluation and selection of ideas typically come in a later stage of the decision-making process.

*The difference between Late Finish and Early Finish*

 - The Early Finish is the earliest time a task can finish based on the project schedule
  - the Late Finish is the latest time a task can finish without delaying the project 
The difference between these two values gives the slack or float time for that task.

also exist :
- **Total Float(Total Slack) : amount of time a task can be delayed without delaying the project completion date and is the difference between the Late Start and Early Start or Late Finish and Early Finish.
- **Free Float:** Free float is the amount of time a task can be delayed without delaying the early start of its successor task. It is specific to a particular task and does not affect tasks on parallel paths. It is calculated as the difference between the Early Start of the successor task and the Late Finish of the current task.




# Schedule compression Tecnique (to shrink) ()

Schedule compression techniques are methods used in project management to shorten the project schedule without changing the project scope

format is (if the predecessor task is *BLANK*  this task wich is depenent will *BLANK* )

1. **SS**(Start-to-Start): (start only if another is started)

2. **FS**(Finish-to-Start):(start only if another is finished)

3. **SF (Start-to-Finish):** (finish only if anther start)

4. **FF (Finish-to-Finish):**(finish only if another finish)
