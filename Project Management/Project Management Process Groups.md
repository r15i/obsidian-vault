## Project Management process groups 
The Project Management Process Groups are a set of **interrelated** **phases** that **represent** the entire **project life cycle**.
## NOTE 
Process Groups are not a [[Project Management#Project Management Life Cycle (PMLC)|PMLC]] but are mapped to PMLC

# Five Project Management Process Groups
Refer to a set of interrelated and distinct phases or stages that a project goes through from initiation to closure.
#### The Scoping PG 
**Develop** and gain **approval** of a **general statement** of the goal and business value of the project 
#### The Planning PG
Identify work to be done and estimate time, cost and resource requirements and gain approval 
#### The Launching PG 
Recruit the team and establish team operating rules 
#### The Monitoring & Controlling PG 
Respond to change request and resolve problem situations to maintain project progress.
#### The Closing Process Group 
Assure attainment of client requirements and install deliverables

#### **Project Time Management**
##### Estimate task duration 
- Expert advice
- Similarity with other activities
- historical data 
-  Delphi technique (ideato da RAND) (tecnique to estimate in absence of expert advice)
		![[Pasted image 20240121220618.png]]
		1. the group is briefed on the project 
		2. Group is asked best guess of the duration of a task or the project
		3. the results are tablulated and presented to the group (in a histogram) (**first pass**)
		4. Partecipants that fall in the outer quartiles are asked to share the reason fot the guess 
		5. back to 2 (called second,third pass)
- Three-point technique 
	  ![[Pasted image 20240121221518.png]]
		  Probabilistic method the formula(a weighted average) and Optimistic, Pessimistic and  Most Likely time estimation of task duration
- Wide-band Delphi technique![[Pasted image 20240121221540.png]]
		utilizes the average value from the a Delphi iteration as a most likely case in the 3 point

#### **Project Cost Management**
- Labor Rates (costo del lavoro)(Single and by position class)
- Capital Equipment
- Contracted Services	

#### **Project Quality Management**
Definition of quality: Fit for use,meets all client requirements, 
Delivered on time within budget and according to client specification 
#### Types of Quality
- Process Quality: The quality of the project management process that produced the product, service or busidness 
- Product Quality: The quality of the deliverables from the project

Actions of quality:
- Quality Planning: Factors that influence the quality 
- Quality assurance 
- Quality control
     Monitor project performance to determine compliance to quality standards and how to eliminate non-compliance 

#### **Project Human Resources Management**
- Project Team ([[Collaborative Project Team#The Collaborative Co-Manager Model|team components]])
- Skills and competences
#### **Project Communications Management**
Communication inside and to the stakeholders

**Communication**  is the process of passing information and understanding from one person to another 
- Transmitted properly 
- message sent is message received

##### Types of interfaces 
![[Pasted image 20240112114738.png]]
#### **Project Risk Management
- Risk identification 
- Risk Assessment 
- Risk Mitigation 
- Risk Monitoring
#### Risk identification 
    ![[Pasted image 20240112114952.png]]
	![[Pasted image 20240112115119.png]]
#### Risk assessment
  what is the probability of loss that results from them, how much are the losses likely to cost, what might the losses be if the worst happens

###### Dynamic Risk Assessment Worksheet
![[Pasted image 20240112115813.png]]
#### Risk mitigation
what are the alternatives?
How can the losses be reduced or eliminated?
 - Accept 
 - Avoid
 - Contingency planning 
 - Mitigate 
 - Transfer
#### Risk monitoring & control
