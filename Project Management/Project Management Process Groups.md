The Project Management Process Groups are a set of interrelated phases that represent the entire project life cycle.


# Five Project Management Process Groups
Refer to a set of interrelated and distinct phases or stages that a project goes through from initiation to closure.
#### The Scoping PG

- Quality Planning: Factors that influence the quality 
- Quality assurance 
     - Quality Audits
     - Process Analysis 
     - Project Quality Management Tools 
- Quality control
     Monitor project performance to determine compliance to quality standards and how to eliminate non-compliance 

A Quality plan documents :
- How the policy are met and with wich metrics
- Process improvement program

#### **Project Human Resources Management**

	![[Pasted image 20240112115119.png]]
#### Risk assessment
  what is the probability of loss that results from them, how much are the losses likely to cost, what might the losses be if the worst happens 
	
###### Static risk Assessment Matrix

- impact=loss
###### Dynamic Risk Assessment Worksheet
![[Pasted image 20240112115813.png]]

what are the alternatives?
How can the losses be reduced or eliminated?
 - Accept 
 - Avoid
 - Contingency planning

## Process Groups PMLC 
 One for each fase of the PMLC (scoping planning launching
 monitoring and controlling) but note they **are not** the same thing
