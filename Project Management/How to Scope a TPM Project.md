### Requirements 

A requirement is something the **product/project** should do/produce or a quality that it must have.
##### Business Value Perspective
A requirement is a desired **end-state** whose successful integration into the solution **meets** one or more **needs** and delivers **specific, measurable, and incremental business** value to the organization
##### Types of requirements
##### Functional and Non-functional Requirements  
- **Functional requirements** : specify what the **product or service must do**
	ex.  when a site visitor creates an account, the sending of a confirmation email
- **Non-functional requirements** demonstrate **properties** that the product or service **should have** in order to do **what must be done**(a consequence )  
	  ex.  The fact that the email must be sent in 10 minutes
##### Global Requirement
Can be seen **General requirements** ex A drill need to be able to drill

### Requirement Gathering 
How to Gather information for the requirements 
1. **Brainstorming** 
	 - Reduces social inihibitions
	 - Stimulates idea
	 - Increase overall creativity
     **Risks**
     - one individual dominance
     - people dislike being criticized in particular evaluating their idea
2. **Facilitated Group Sessions**
   - Excellent for cross-functional processes
   - Detailed requirements are documented and verified
   - Resolves issues with an impartial facilitator
     **Risk**
      - Untrained facilitators can lead to negative responses
      - Time and cost of planning and executing can be high
3. **Interviews**
   - End-user participation 
   - High-level description of functions and processes provided 
     **Risk**
     - Description may differ from actual detailed activities
     - Without structure, stakeholders may not know what information to provide
     - Real needs ignored if analyst is prejudiced
4. **Prototyping** 
   - Innovative ideas 
   - Users clarify what they want 
   - Users identify requirements that may ne missed
   - Client-focused 
   - Early proof of concept 
   - Stimulates thought process
	**Risk**
	  - Client may want to implement prototype
	  - Difficult to know when to stop
	  - Specialized skills required
	  - Absence of documentation 
5. **Requirements Workshop**
   - Good Way for first time use 
	 **Risk**
	 - May overwhelm customer
