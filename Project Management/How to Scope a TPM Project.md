## Client Wants vs Client Needs 
What your client wants may not be what your client needs:

Our job is to make sure that
 - what they want is what they need 
 - that you are able to deliver


### Managing Client Expectations During Scoping 
- Make sure you understand what your client wants/needs/expects 
- Make sure the client understands what you will do 
- Assure yourself that what your client wants is what your client needs
- Actively include your client in scoping the project 
- Put yourself in the shoes of your client 
- Meaningfully involve your client wherever possible 
- Keep your client informed of project status

How to conduct a meeting 
#### Purpose 
- Document requirements

#### Attendees 
- Project Manager 
- Client Group 
- Core Team Members
- The Facilitator & Technographer
#### Agenda 
- Introductions 
- Porpose of the meeting (led by Facilitator)

- Draft and approve the POS(whole group)
- Adjourn
#### Deliverables
- RBS creation
- Assessment of completeness of RBS
- Project classification 
- Determination of best fit PMLC Model
- The POS

#### Requirements 

A requirement is something the product/project should do/produce or a quality that it must have.

A requirement is a desired end-state whose successful integration into the solution meets one or more needs and delivers specific, measurable, and incremental business value to the organization

Furthermore the set of high-level requirements form a necessary and sufficient set for the attainment of incremental business value 

### Requirements Breakdown Structure (RBS)
![[Pasted image 20240112154338.png]]
The RBS
- is intuitive and most meaningful to the client 
- a deliverables based approach 
- consistent with the PMI PMBOK
- remains client facing as long as possible int the planning exercise

Advantages of using the RBS:
- Does not require a trained facilitator 
- Does not require learning one of the contemporary approaches to requirements gathering 
- Presents an intuitive approach to gathering requirements 
- Allows the client to work with the project team in an enviroment familiar to them(comfort zone)
- Paints a clear picture of the degree to wich the solution is clearly defined
- Provides the input needed to choose the best PMLC Model 


## Stakeholder Interaction in Requirements

### Requirement Gathering 
How to Gather information for the requirements 
1. Brainstorming 
   - reduced social inhibitions 
   - Stimulates idea generation
   - Increases overall creativity of the group
     **Risks**
     - Can be dominated by a strong individual 
     - Individual fear of being criticized
2. Facilitated Group Sessions
   - Excellent for cross-functional processes
   - Detailed requirements are documented and verified
   - Resolves issues with an impartial facilitator
     **Risk**
      - Untrained facilitators can lead to negative responses
      - Time and cost of planning and executing can be high
3. Interviews
   - End-user participation 
   - High-level description of functions and processes provided 
     **Risk**
     - Description may differ from actual detailed activities
     - Without structure, stakeholders may not know what information to provide
     - Real needs ignored if analyst is prejudiced
     
4. Prototyping 
   - Innovative ideas 
   - Users clarify what they want 
   - Users identify requirements that may ne missed
   - Client-focused 
   - Early proof of concept 
   - Stimulates thought process
	**Risk**
	  - Client may want to implement prototype
	  - Difficult to know when to stop
	  - Specialized skills required
	  - Absence of documentation 
5. Requirements Workshop
   - Good Way for first time use 
	 **Risk**
	 - May overwhelm customer



## Functional vs Non-functional Requirements  
- **Functional requirements** : specify what the product or service must do 
- **Non-functional requirements** demonstrate properties that the product or service should have in order to do what must be done 
#### Example 
- Functional $\rightarrow$ when a site visitor creates an account, the sending of a confirmation email
- Non-Functional $\rightarrow$ The fact that the email must be sent in 10 minutes

## Global Requirement
Global requirements describe the highest level of requirements within the **system of product** (General requirements) (A drill need to be able to drill )

## Product/Project Constraint 
**Product/project** constraints are those requirements that, on the surface, **resemble design constraint of project constraints**





## Requirement Management

### Purpose of the Project Overview Statements (POSs)
a one-page description that is :
- A general statement of the project 
- A reference of the planning team 
- A decision aid for the project 
- To get management approval to plan the project 

## Contents of the project Overview Statement 

![[Pasted image 20240112162317.png]]


## POS Problem/Opportunity 
A problem needing resolution or an untapped business opportunity

## POS Project Goal 
A one of two sentence statement of how you intend to address the stated problem/opportunity 
A scoping statement that bound the project you are proposing 

## POS Project Objectives 
- 5/6 brief statements that further bound your project goal 
-  from these it is clear what is the proposed project 
- these statements might identify major project deliverables
- These statements form a necessary and sufficient set of objectives 


## POS Success Criteria 
##### IRACIS 
- IR  : increasing Revenue 
- AC : Avoiding Cost 
- IS   : Improving Service 
Use quantitative metrics only! how much and by when?

## POS Assumptions/Risks/Obstacles 
- Technological  : New to the company, Obsolescence
- Environmental : Management change 
- Interpersonal   : Working relationships 
- Cultural            : Fit to the company  
- Causal Relationships: Will the solution solve the problem 

# POS Attachments 
- Risk Analysis 
- Financial Analyses :
	- Feasibility studies
	- Cost/benefit analysis 
	- Break-even analysis 
	- Return on investment
