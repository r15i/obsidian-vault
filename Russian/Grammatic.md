1. **Grammatical Cases:**
   - Russian uses a system of six grammatical cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, and prepositional. Each case serves a specific grammatical function, indicating the role of a noun or pronoun in a sentence.

2. **[[Noun Gender]]:**
   - Russian nouns are classified into three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. The gender of a noun affects the forms of associated adjectives, pronouns, and verbs.

3. **[[Verb Conjugation]]**:
   - Verbs in Russian are conjugated based on the person, number, and gender of the subject. There are three persons (first, second, and third), two numbers (singular and plural), and three genders.

4. **Aspect of Verbs:**
   - Russian verbs have two aspects: imperfective and perfective. The imperfective aspect is used for ongoing or repeated actions, while the perfective aspect indicates completed or one-time actions.
     
5. **Adjective Agreement:**
   - Adjectives in Russian agree with the gender, number, and case of the nouns they modify. This means that the form of the adjective changes based on the characteristics of the noun it accompanies.

6. **Pronouns:**
   - Russian pronouns, including personal, possessive, and demonstrative pronouns, change their forms based on gender, number, and case. Reflexive pronouns are also commonly used in Russian.

7. **Numerals:**
   - Russian numerals agree with the nouns they modify in terms of gender, number, and case. There are specific forms for counting (cardinal numerals) and for indicating order (ordinal numerals).

8. **Prepositions:**
   - Russian prepositions govern specific cases, influencing the form of the noun or pronoun following them. The choice of preposition depends on the intended meaning and the grammatical case required.

9. **Word Stress:**
   - Russian is a language with fixed word stress. The stress pattern can affect the pronunciation and meaning of words. It is important to correctly place stress in order to convey the intended meaning.

10. **Aspect of Nouns:**
    - In addition to the aspect of verbs, Russian nouns can have animate or inanimate gender, and this choice can affect the forms of associated words.

11. **Negation:**
    - Negation in Russian involves using the word "не" (not) to negate a statement. The placement of "не" can vary depending on the sentence structure.
