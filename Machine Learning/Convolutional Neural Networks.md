# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
![[Pasted image 20231229153611.png]]

- Local connectiovity: receptive filed for each neuron 
	![[Pasted image 20231229154018.png]]
		each neuron in connected only with related other neuron 

- Shared ("tied") weights: spatially invariant response
	![[Pasted image 20231229163534.png]]
	every connection to a neuron share the same weights but with a **different input window**
	that slides across all the neurons of lvl -1	
	




- Multiple feature maps
- ![[Pasted image 20231229163751.png]]
	each feature map of neurons share the same weights and slide on the neurons with a input window

	the desitination  neurons are called **FEATURE MAPS** and are used to compute different functions

- convolution
	


- Subsampling(pooling)
