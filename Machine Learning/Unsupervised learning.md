Unlabeled data: Training data is not labeled 

# **Target** 
find a function that describes the structure of the data

## **Main idea and most used approach**
data is the realization of an **hidden probability density function** , unsupervised learning is liked to the density estimation of a hiddedn PDF

# Unsupervised Learning Techniques
1. [[Clustering]]: [[K-means]] and [[Linkage-based clustering]]

2. Dimensionality reduction: 
	- [[Principal Component Analysis (PCA)]]

3. OTHER: Mean shift clustering, spectral clustering,....
4. Compressive sensing
