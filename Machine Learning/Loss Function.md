# Generalized Loss Function

Given : 
-$H$ : hypothesis class 
-$Z$ : domain ($X \times Y$)
a **loss function** is any function $l :  H\times Z \rightarrow R_{+}$

It has a different [[True Error#True error with Generalized Loss function|true error definition ]] and an [[Empirical Error#Empirical error with Generalized Loss function|empirical error definition]]



# Common loss Functions

Generally the loss function depends on the application but common used are:

- [[0-1 loss]]
- [[Cross Entropy]]
- [[Squared Loss (L2)]] 
- [[Absolute value loss (L1)]] 

to keep in mind **Computational power need to be taken into account**
