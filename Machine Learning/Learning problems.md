
Domain set and traing data have the same structure for all problems 

Learner output : h : $X \rightarrow Y$ 

# Binary classification

Target set $Y = \{0,1\}$  $|Y| = 2$ 
we decide if the feature are somenthing or no

# Multiclass classification
With $K > 2$  
Target set $Y = \{0,1,...,K-1\}$  $|Y| = K$

Loss function: as for the binary case

# Regression 
Target set $Y = R$
