we use a relaxation of f ([[target labeling function]]) and assume $D$ is a probability distribution over $X \times Y$ 
$D$ has 2 components: 
- $D_x$ (marginal) distribution over domain points
- $D((x,y)|x)$ conditional distribution over labels for each domain point

in many applications it is not realistic that  the **labeling is fully determined** by the features
