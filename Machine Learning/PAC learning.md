## Probabily Approximately Correct (PAC)

Since the training data is sampled accordingly to $D$
we can only be:
- **approximately** :  accuracy parameter $L_{D,f}(h_{s})\leq \epsilon$ 
 - **probably** :  confidence parameter , 
			$h_s$ is a good hypothesis with probability  $\geq 1-\delta$	 
**correct**
