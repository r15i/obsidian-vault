![[Pasted image 20231124151929.png]]

algo: 
1 start with a rough grid of values 
2 plot the correspondig model-selection curve
3 based on the curve, zoom in the correct region 
4 restart from 1 
grid search does not always find the GLOBAL OPTIMUM for the set of parameters, but it is a reasonable approximation
