![[Pasted image 20240105213323.png]]
### Domain Set
$X$ is the domain set (or instance space ) of all possible objects to make predictions
$x\in X$ is a domain point or instance (vector of numbers called **features**)  
### Label set
$Y$ is a set of possible labels (ex $Y = {0,1}$)
### Training set
$S=((x_1,y_1),...,(x_m,y_m))$ **Finite** sequence of **labeled** $\rightarrow$ **supervised** learning

#### Prediction rule 
$h: X\rightarrow Y$ (or $\hat{f}$)  the learnr's output, called also:
- predictior
- **hypothesis**
- classifier

$A(S)$ prediction rule produced by ML alg. $A$ with a $S$ training set
as set of prediction rules, or hypothesis is called [[Hypothesis Class]]

### Probability distribution
instances $A(S)$ are generated by $D$  , probability distribution on $X$ 

#### Data-generation model
instances generated by $D$  (UKNOWN BY THE ALGO) are labeled to a function $f$ (UKNOWN BY THE ALGO)



#### Training set
$\forall\,\, x_i\in S$, sample $x_i$ according to $D$ then label it as $y_i=f(x_i)$ 

#### Measure of success 
measure of success of the net can be traced by [[Error]]


#### [[Pac learning]]
Probably approximately correct learning is a paradigm that measure the precision of our model based on two parameters $\epsilon$ and $\delta$  for **accuracy** and **confidence**
