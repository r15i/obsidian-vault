Assuming you've used the template with the command `npx degit sveltejs/template my-svelte-app`, here is a breakdown of the project structure:

```
my-svelte-app/
|-- public/
|   |-- favicon.png
|   |-- global.css
|-- src/
|   |-- components/
|   |   |-- HelloWorld.svelte
|   |-- App.svelte
|   |-- main.js
|-- .gitignore
|-- package.json
|-- README.md
|-- rollup.config.js
```

Now, let's explain each part of the structure:

1. **`public/`**: This directory contains files that will be publicly accessible. For example:
   - **`favicon.png`**: The favicon (icon displayed in the browser tab).
   - **`global.css`**: A global CSS file that can be used to define styles applied throughout the application.

2. **`src/`**: This directory contains the source code of your Svelte application:
   - **`components/`**: A directory where you can place your Svelte components. The template includes a sample component named `HelloWorld.svelte`.
   - **`App.svelte`**: **The main component of your application. This is the root component that gets rendered.**
   - **`main.js`**: **The entry point of your application. It imports the main Svelte component (`App.svelte`) and mounts it to the DOM.**

3. **`.gitignore`**: A file that specifies patterns that should be ignored by Git. It's used to exclude certain files or directories from version control.

4. **`package.json`**: A configuration file for npm that includes metadata about the project, dependencies, and scripts. It also specifies the main entry point (`main.js` in this case).

5. **`README.md`**: A readme file containing information about the project. It often includes instructions on how to set up and run the project.

6. **`rollup.config.js`**: The configuration file for Rollup, the bundler used by Svelte to bundle the JavaScript code. It defines how the source code is transformed and bundled for production.

This structure provides a good starting point for building Svelte applications. As you develop your app, you might add more components, assets, or additional configuration files based on your specific needs. The `src` directory is where you'll spend most of your time, creating and organizing Svelte components.
