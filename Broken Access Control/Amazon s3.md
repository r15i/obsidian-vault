An Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) bucket is a cloud storage resource provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. S3 is highly scalable, durable, and secure, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases such as hosting static websites, storing backup files, serving media content, and much more. Each object stored in an S3 bucket is identified by a unique key within the bucket.

AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified tool that provides a command-line interface for managing various AWS services. It allows you to interact with AWS resources directly from your terminal or command prompt. With the AWS CLI, you can perform a wide range of tasks, such as managing EC2 instances, configuring S3 buckets, creating IAM roles, and much more, all using simple commands. This can be particularly useful for automating tasks, scripting, and managing AWS resources in a programmatic manner.
