1. **Efficient Binary Format**: WebAssembly is designed to be efficiently parsed and executed by browsers, leading to faster load times and execution.
    
2. **Close to Machine Code**: WebAssembly is closer to the machine code that runs on the CPU, allowing it to be more efficient for certain types of operations.
    
3. **Optimized Execution**: Because WebAssembly is a lower-level language, it allows for more aggressive compiler optimizations, resulting in faster execution speeds.
    
4. **Predictable Performance**: JavaScript performance can vary depending on the browser and the optimizations performed by the JavaScript engine. WebAssembly, on the other hand, offers more predictable performance across different environments.
    
5. **Multithreading Support**: While JavaScript runs in a single-threaded environment (although with async features), WebAssembly can take advantage of multithreading, which can significantly speed up certain types of computations.
    

However, it's essential to note that WebAssembly is

## maybe
### ONNX  as format for the model

i'm in doubt in using onnx because i don't know how efficient is to use this kind of format when i could just compress the shit out of the weights
